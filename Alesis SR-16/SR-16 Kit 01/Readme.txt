You have downloaded 1 of 16 zips of samples taken from the Alesis SR16
drum machine.  The machine has 233 samples altogether.  All samples are
44,100 hertz 16 bit samples.  All the names are the same except toms
which have numbers in front to keep the same type of toms together.

A list of all the zips:-

3 bass drums
1 hi hat
2 cymbols
2 percussion
3 snare drums
5 toms

Thanks to the nice people at Alesis for letting me sample their 
drum machine.  

If you do not wish to download these yourself, I can send you a CD.
Contact me at dayledave@austin75.freeserve.co.uk

Any other samples would be greatly appreciated.

Cheers

Dave
